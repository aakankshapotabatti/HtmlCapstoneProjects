## **Problem Statement:**  
Many local car service centers do not have an online presence, making it difficult for customers to know about services or book appointments easily. This project solves that by providing a simple, HTML-based website with all the important features like services list, booking form, and confirmation pages.

## **Conclusion / Outcome:**  
The **AutoMob-Mechanic** website is a simple and clean multi-page web application made using only HTML. It includes pages like home, services, booking, and success confirmation. It shows how a small business like a car repair shop can go digital with basic web skills. This can later be enhanced using CSS for design and JavaScript for dynamic features.
