## **Problem Statement:**  
In an increasingly digital world, the ability to stay socially connected is vital. However, many platforms are overly complex or require heavy backend systems for even simple interactions. There is a need for a minimal, lightweight, static solution that simulates basic social networking features like friend registration, viewing friend lists, and simple user interaction without relying on databases or servers.

## **Conclusion / Outcome:**  
The **Friendship Zone** project successfully implements a multi-page static website with essential features like homepage navigation, user registration, friend listing, and confirmation pages. It demonstrates how HTML can be used to structure a basic front-end system for a social application prototype. The project also lays a groundwork that can later be expanded with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity and backend integration.
